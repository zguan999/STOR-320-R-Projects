#Introduction

Universities are typically opaque, bureaucratic institutions. To be transparent to tax payers, many public schools, such as the University of North Carolina, openly report **[salary information](http://www.newsobserver.com/news/databases/public-salaries/)**. In this assignment, we will analyze this information to answer pivotal questions that have endured over the course of time. The most recent salary data for UNC-Chapel Hill faculty and staff has already been downloaded in CSV format and titled *"UNC_System_Salaries Search and Report.csv"*. If you scan the spreadsheet, you will notice that Dr. Mario is not listed. People get depressed when they see that many digits after the decimal.

To answer all the questions, you will need the R package `tidyverse` to make figures and utilize `dplyr` functions.


```{r setup, include=F}
options(scipen=999)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

#Data Information

Make sure the CSV data file is contained in the folder of your RMarkdown file. First, we start by using the `read_csv` function from the `readr` package found within the tidyverse. The code below executes this process by creating a tibble in your R environment named "salary".
```{r, message=F}
salary=read_csv("UNC_System_Salaries Search and Report.csv")
```

Now, we will explore the information that is contained in this dataset. The code below provides the names of the variables contained in the dataset.

```{r}
names(salary)
```

Next, we will examine the type of data contains in these different variables. 
```{r}
str(salary,give.attr=F)
```

You will notice that the variable "hiredate" is recorded as a character. The following code will first modify the original dataset to change this to a date variable with the format *mm/dd/yyyy*. Then, we will remove the hyphens to create a numeric variable as *yyyymmdd*. Finally, in the spirit of tidyverse, we will convert this data frame to a tibble

```{r}
salary$hiredate=as.Date(salary$hiredate, format="%m/%d/%Y")
salary$hiredate=as.numeric(gsub("-","",salary$hiredate))
salary=as.tibble(salary)
```

Now, we will use `head()` to view of first five rows and the modifications made to the original data. The rest of the assignment will extend off this modified dataset named `salary` which by now should be in your global environment.
```{r}
head(salary,5)
```

# Assignment


## Part 1: Reducing the Data to a Smaller Set of Interest


###Q1 *(2 Points)* 

Create a new dataset named `salary2` that only contains the following variables:

- "Name"

- "dept"

- "position"

- "hiredate"

- "exempt"

- "totalsal"

Then, use the `names()` function to display the variable names of `salary2`.
```{r}
#
salary2 <- select(salary, Name,dept,position,hiredate,exempt,totalsal)
head(salary2)
```

###Q2 *(2 Points)*

Now, we modify `salary2`. Rename the variables "dept","position","exempt","totalsal" to "Department","Job","Exempt", and "Salary", respectively. Do this for a new dataset called `salary3` and use `names()` to display the variable names of `salary3`.
```{r}
#
salary3<-rename(salary2, Department= dept,Job=position,  Exempt= exempt, Salary=totalsal)
head(salary3)
```

###Q3 *(2 Points)*

Now, we modify `salary3`. Create a new variable called "HireYear" that only contains the first four digits of the variable "hiredate" in a new dataset named `salary4`. *Hint: Use the concept seen in the conversion of flight times to minutes since midnight.* Use the function `str()` to ensure that your new variable "HireYear" reports the year of the date that the employee was hired.

```{r}
#
salary4<-mutate(salary3,HireYear=hiredate%/%10000)
str(salary4, give.attr = F)
head(salary4)
```

###Q4 *(2 points)*

Now, we modify `salary4`. Create a new variable called "YrsEmployed" which reports the number of full years the employee has worked at UNC. Assume that all employees are hired January 1. Create a new dataset named `salary5` and again use `str()` to display the variables in `salary5`.
```{r}
#
salary5<-mutate(salary4, YrsEmployed = 2019-HireYear)
str(salary5, give.attr = F)
head(salary5)
```

###Q5 *(4 points)*

Now, we modify `salary5` to create our final dataset named `salary.final`. Use the pipe `%>%` to make the following changes:

- Drop the variables "hiredate" and "HireYear". 

- Sort the observations first by "Department" and then by "YrsEmployed". 

- Rearrange the variables so that "YrsEmployed" and "Salary" are the first two variables in the dataset, in that order, without removing any of the other variables.

After you have used the `%>%` to make these changes, use the function `head()` to display the first 10 rows of `salary.final`.

```{r}
#
salary.final <- salary5 %>% select(-c(hiredate, HireYear)) %>% select(YrsEmployed, Salary, Department, Job, Exempt)
head(salary.final,10)
```

```{r}
# 
family<-filter(salary.final, Department == "Family Medicine", Exempt == "Exempt from Personnel Act" , YrsEmployed<=6)
nrow(family)
```

Code *(2 Points)*:
```{r}
#

public_policy <- filter(salary.final, Department == "Public Policy", Job %in% c("Professor","Associate Professor", "Assistant Professor"))
median(public_policy$Salary)
```

Answer *(2 Points)*: (Place Answer Here Using Complete Sentences)

The median salary for Public Policy Professors, Associate Professors and Assistant Professors is $101408.

##Part 3: Answering Questions Based on Summarized Data

###Q9 *(4 Points)*

Based off the data in `salary.final`, create a grouped summary based off combinations of "Department" and "YrsEmployed". Call the new tibble `deptyear_summary`. Your summarized tibble, `deptyear_summary`, should report all of the following statistics with corresponding variable names.

- "n" = number of employees for each combination

- "mean" = average salary for each combination

- "sd" = standard deviation of salary for each combination.

- "prop70" = proportion of employees making at least $70,000 in salary for each combination.

In the process, make sure you use `ungroup()` with the pipe `%>%` to release the grouping so future work is no longer group specific. Following the creation of `deptyear_summary`, prove that your code worked by using `head()` to view the first 10 rows.

```{r}
#

deptyear_summary<- salary.final %>% group_by(Department,YrsEmployed) %>%
  summarize(n=n(),
          mean=mean(Salary,na.rm=TRUE),
          sd=sd(Salary,na.rm=TRUE),
          prop70= mean(Salary >=70000, na.rm=TRUE)
  ) %>% ungroup()
head(deptyear_summary,10)


```

###Q10 *(4 Points)*

Using the summarized data in `deptyear_summary`, use the `dplyr` functions to identify the 3 departments that award the lowest average salary for employees who have been employed for 3 years. The output should only show the 3 departments along with the corresponding years employeed, which should all be 3, and the four summarizing statistics created. 

Furthermore, explain why the standard deviation for one of the 3 departments in your list has a salary standard deviation of "NaN". What does this mean and how did it occur?

Code *(2 Points)*:
```{r}
#
deptyear_summ <- deptyear_summary %>% filter(YrsEmployed == 3)%>% arrange(mean)

head(deptyear_summ,3)
```

Answer *(2 Points)*: (Place Answer Here Using Complete Sentences)

In the data, the standard deviation Acad Initative-UBC for groups that were 3 years employed came up to be NaN. The reason being that standard deviation needs more than 1 observation to calculate, as the denominator for std dev. is n-1. You cannot divide by 0, therefore Acad Initatives-UBC's standard deviation turned out to be 0.


###Q11 *(4 points)*

Create a scatter plot using `geom_point()` along with fitted lines using `geom_smooth` with the argument `method="lm"` showing the linear relationship between average salary and the years employeed. For this plot, use the summarized data in `deptyear_summary`. Following the plot, please explain what this plot suggests about the relationship between the salary a UNC employee makes and how many years that employee has served. Make reference to the figure and use descriptive adjectives (i.e. "strong", "weak", etc.) and terms (i.e. "positive", "negative", etc.) that are appropriate for discussing linear relationships.

Code and Figure *(2 Points)*:
```{r}
#
ggplot(data = deptyear_summary, mapping = aes(x = mean, y = YrsEmployed)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm)

```

Answer *(2 Points)*: (Place Answer Here Using Complete Sentences)

The linear model suggests that with increases in salaries for UNC employees, the years employed would increase as well. The relationship of the line does not seem to have strong correlation to the data, but rather weak correlation. The slope of the line is not steep which implies for each increase in price, the employed does not increase by much. In conclusion the linear model suggests a positive, weak correlation between the two variables. 

###Q12 *(6 Points)*

The purpose of summarizing the data was to analyze the previously discussed linear relationship by group. In `deptyear_summary`, there are 702 unique departments represented. You can verify this by using `length(unique(deptyear_summary$Department))`. In this part, I want you to select 3 academic departments, not previously discussed, and in one figure, display the scatter plots and fitted regression lines representing the relationship between average salary and years employed in three different colors. Then, in complete sentences, I want you to state what departments you chose and explain the differences and/or similarities between the groups regarding the previously mentioned relationship. Compare departments on the starting salary and the rate of increase in salary based on the fitted lines.


Code and Figure: *(3 Points)*:
```{r}
#
department_three <- filter(deptyear_summary, Department %in% c("Computer Science","Statistics and Operations Res","Biostatistics - Ops"))

ggplot(data = department_three, mapping = aes(x = mean, y =YrsEmployed, color = Department)) +geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm)

```

Answer *(3 Points)*: (Place Answer Here Using Complete Sentences)

All three departments that I chose, Biostatistics, Computer Science, and Statistics and Operations Res, have a positive linear relationship with Salary and Years Employed. This means that for each increase in mean salary, the years employed will increase for all 3 departments.The differences in the data is the steepness of the lines. The steepest slope is for Statistics and Operations Res, and Computer Science is almost as steep. The least steep slope is Biostat, with a slope that is almost flat. Each of the variables seem to have moderate linear relationship. The starting salary for Biostatstics, Computer Science and Statstics is ~>$50,000, but Statstics had the lowest starting salary, a little lower than $50,000. Computer Science had a starting salary exactly at $50,000 and Biostat is a little above $50,000. All of these are based of the linear model.
