```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

# Chapter 1 (Pgs. 6-7)

##  Exercise 1
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)
```

1. I see absolutely nothing. There is just a blank space for a graph. Why am I even doing this nonsense?

## Exercise 2
```{r}
dim(mpg)
nrow(mpg)
ncol(mpg)
```
There are 32 rows and 11 columns in the dataset **mpg**.

##  Exercise 3
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?mpg
```

```{r}
unique(mpg$drv)
```


The variable **drg** is a factor variable that takes the following values:

- "f" = front-wheel drive
- "r" = rear-wheel drive
- "4" = 4-wheel drive

##  Excercise 4
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg,aes(x=hwy,y=cyl)) +
  geom_point() + 
  xlab("Highway Miles Per Gallon") +
  ylab("Number of Cylinders")
```


##  Excercise 5
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg,aes(x=cyl,y=drv)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  xlab("Number of Cylinders") +
  ylab("Type of Drive")
```

Scatter plots are not meant to visualize the relationship between two categorical/qualitative variables. 

# Chapter 1 (Pg. 12)

##  Exercise 1
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg) + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy),color="blue") 
```

color was treated as a variable since it was inside the aes brackets. Must move color=blue outside of mapping section to manually assign a color. 

##  Exercise 2
```{r}
#ggplot2::mpg
```
The categorical variables in mpg include: model, trans, fl, class, drv, manufacturer. The only continuous variable is displ. 

##  Exercise 5
```{r}
#
ggplot(data=mpg)+ geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy, stroke=cty))
```

stroke works like shape, the size of the dots are based on variable cty.

# Chapter 1 (Pgs. 20-21)

##  Exercise 1
```{r}
#
```
When you want a line graph, use geom_line. When boxplot is needed, use geom_boxplot. For Histograms, use geom_histogram.

##  Exercise 2
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg,mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy,color=drv,)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se=F)
```

##  Exercise 3
```{r}
#
ggplot(data=mpg,mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy,color=drv,)) +
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(se=F,show.legend=FALSE)
```

No legend is generated for specified geom when show.legend = FALSE. 

##  Exercise 4
```{r}
#
ggplot(data=mpg,mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy,color=drv,)) +
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(se=T)
```

Shows standard error boundaries around the curve based off of the actual data. 

##  Exercise 5

I don't know if they will look different. Let me check.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()

ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

They do not look different. I am incredibly surprised.

# Open Response

For this exercise, use the **diamonds** dataset in the tidyverse. Use `?diamonds` to get more information about the dataset.

## Step 1: Select 1 numeric variable and 2 categorical variables. Create a graphic using `geom_boxplot()` and `facet_wrap` to illustrate the empirical distributions of the sample.
```{r}
ggplot(data=diamonds) +geom_boxplot(mapping =aes(x=color,y=price), color="sky blue") + facet_wrap(~clarity) +xlab("Color")+ylab("Price($)")
```


## Step 2: Choose 2 numeric variables and 2 categorical variables and creatively illustrate the relationship between all the variables. 
```{r}
ggplot(data=diamonds) +geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price,color=color,shape=cut))
```
